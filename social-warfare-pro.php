	 * to be an exact match, everything on or after this version will simply
	 * run using existence checks. This will allow that the bulk of the plugin
	 * continues to run smoothly. Only features that are missing their
	 * dependencies will gracefully deactivate until the other plugin is updated.
	 *
	 * If core is available, and it's on 3.3.0 or higher, we'll go ahead and
	 * load and instantiate the Social Warfare Pro class to fire up the plugin.
	 *
	 * Each subsequent version will be made to be compatable with all versions
	 * within the same major version subset. For example:
	 *
	 * 3.3.0 with 3.4.1 = Compatible
	 * 4.1.0 with 4.0.0 = Compatible
	 * 4.1.0 with 3.4.1 = Not Compatible
	 *
	 * Failure to find a compatible version of the core plugin will cause the
	 * pro plugin to gracefully remain unloaded and will alert the user to the
	 * mismatch via a WordPress admin notification.
